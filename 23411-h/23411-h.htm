     Sahara Saying.
</pre>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away in the desert I heard the sound of a flute, pure sound in the
      pure air, delicate, sometimes almost comic with the comicality of a child
      who bends women to kisses and to nonsense-words. We had passed through the
      sandstorm, Safti and I, over the wastes of saltpetre, and come into a land
      of palm gardens where there was almost breathless calm. The feet of the
      camels paddled over the soft brown earth of the narrow alleys between the
      brown earth walls, and we looked down to right and left into the shady
      enclosed spaces, seamed with water rills, dotted with little pools of pale
      yellow water, and saw always giant palms, with wrinkled trunks and tufted,
      deep green foliage, brooding in their squadrons over the dimness they had
      made. The activity of man might be discerned here in the regularity of the
      artificial rills, the ordered placing of the trees, each of which, too,
      stood on its oval hump. But no man was seen; no flat-roofed huts appeared;
      no robe, pale blue or white, fluttered among the shadows; no dog blinked
      in the golden patches of the sun&mdash;only the sound of the flute came to
      us from some hidden place ceaselessly, wild and romantic, full of an odd
      coquetry, and of an absurdity that was both uncivilised and touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped to listen, and looked round, searching the vistas between the
      palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does it come from?&rdquo; I asked of Safti.
    </p>
    <p>
      His one eye blinked languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From some gardener among the trees. All who dwell in Sidi-Matou are
      gardeners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The persistent flute gave forth a shower of notes that were like drops of
      water flung softly in our faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in love,&rdquo; added Safti with a slight yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the African is in love he plays upon the pipe. That is what they say
      in the Sahara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think he is alone under some palm-tree playing for himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he is quite alone. If he is much in love he will play all day, and,
      perhaps, all night too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she cannot hear him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not matter. He plays for his own heart, and his own heart can
      hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I listened. Since Safti had spoken the music meant more to me. I tried to
      read the player&rsquo;s heart in the endless song it made. Trills, twitterings,
      grace notes, little runs upward ending in the air&mdash;surely it was a
      boy&rsquo;s heart, and not unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is coming nearer,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Ah, it is Smaïn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Safti&rsquo;s one eye is sharp. I had seen no one. But as he spoke a tall youth
      in a single white garment glided into my view, his eyes bent down, his
      brown fingers fluttering on a long reed flute covered with red arabesques.
      His feet were bare, and he moved slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safti hailed him with the accented violence peculiar to the Arabs. He
      stopped playing, looked, and smiled all over his young face. In a moment
      he was on our side of the earth wall, and talking busily, staring at me
      the while with unabashed curiosity. For few strangers come to Sidi-Amrane,
      and Smaïn had never wandered far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; I asked of Safti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell him we shall be at Touggourt tomorrow night, and shall stay there
      a week. He answers that his heart is there with Oreïda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Does his lady-love live at Touggourt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she is a dancer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smaïn smiled. He did not understand French, but he knew we were speaking
      of his love affair, and he was not afflicted with shyness. As he
      accompanied us to the village he played again, and I read his nature in
      the soft sounds of his flute.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day he stayed with us, and nearly all that day he played. Even
      when he guided me through the village, where, between terraced houses,
      pretty children&mdash;the girls in deep purple, with yellow flowers stuck
      in their left nostrils, the boys in white&mdash;danced with a boisterous
      grace round brushwood fires, his flute was at his lips, and his fingers
      fluttered ceaselessly. And as night drew on the music was surely more
      amorous, and I seemed to see Oreïda drawing near over the sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smaïn was but sixteen, tall and slim as a reed, with a poetic face and
      lustrous, languid eyes. I imagined Oreïda a child too&mdash;one of those
      flowers of the desert that blossom early and fade ere noontide comes.
      Sometimes such flowers are very beautiful. As I heard the flute of Smaïn
      in the pale yellow twilight I knew that Oreïda was beautiful&mdash;with
      one of those exquisite, lithe figures, whose movements make a song; with
      long, narrow dark eyes, mysterious pools of light and shadow; with thick
      hair falling loosely round a low, broad forehead; and perfect little
      hands, made for the dance of the hands that the Bedouin loves so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this I knew from the sound of Smain&rsquo;s flute. I told it to Safti, and
      bade him ask Smaïn if it were not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smain&rsquo;s reply was:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is more beautiful than that; she is like the young gazelle, and like
      the first day after the fast of Ramadan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he played once more while the moon rose over the palm gardens, and
      Safti, lighting his pipe of keef with tender deliberateness, remarked
      placidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would like to come with us to Touggourt and to die there at Oreïda&rsquo;s
      feet, but his father, Said-ben-Kouïdar, wishes him to remain at Sidi-Matou
      and to pack dates. He is young, and must obey. Therefore he is sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smoke rose up in a cloud round Smaïn and his flute, and now I thought
      that, indeed, there was a wild pathos in the music. The moon went up the
      sky, and threw silver on the palms. The gay cries from the village died
      down. The gardeners lay upon the earth divans under the palmwood roofs,
      and slept. And at last Smaïn bade us good-bye. I saw his white figure
      glide across the great open space that the moon made white as it was. And
      when the shadows took him I still heard the faint sound of his flute,
      calling to his heart and to the distant Oreïda through the magical
      stillness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day we reached Touggourt, and in the evening I went with Safti
      and the Caïd of the Nomads to the great café of the dancers in the
      outskirts of the town. At the door Arab soldiers were lounging. The pipes
      squealed within like souls in torment. In the square bonfires were blazing
      fiercely, and the whole desert seemed to throb with beaten drums. Within
      the café was a crowd of Arabs, real nomads, some in rags, some richly
      dressed, all gravely attentive to the dancers, who entered from a court on
      the left, round which their rooms were built in terraces, and danced in
      pairs between the broad divans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me when Oreïda comes,&rdquo; I said to Safti, while the Caïd spread forth
      his ample skirts, and turned a cigarette in his immense black fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dancers came and went. They were amazing trollops, painted until, like
      the picture of Balzac&rsquo;s madman, they were chaotic, a mere mess of frantic
      colours. Not for these, I thought, did Smaïn play his flute. The time wore
      on. I grew drowsy in the keef-laden air, despite the incessant uproar of
      the pipes. Suddenly I started&mdash;Safti had touched me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Oreïda, Sidi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked, and saw a lonely dancer entering from the court, large, weary,
      crowned with gold, tufted with feathers, wrinkled, with greedy, fatigued
      eyes, and hands painted blood-red. She was like an idol in its dotage.
      Over her spreading bosom streamed multitudes of golden coins, and many
      jewels shone upon her wrists, her arms, her withered neck. She advanced
      slowly, as if bored, until she was in the midst of the crowd. Then she
      wriggled, stretched forth her hands, slowly stamped her feet, and
      promenaded to and fro, occasionally revolving like a child&rsquo;s top that is
      on the verge of &ldquo;running down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not Oreïda,&rdquo; I said to Safti, smiling at his absurd mistake. For
      this was the oldest and ugliest dancer of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Sidi, it is. Ask the Caïd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked that enormous potentate, who was devouring the withered lady with
      his eyes. He wagged his head in assent. Just then the dancer paused before
      us, and thrusting forward her greasy forehead, enveloped us with a
      sphinx-like smirk. As I hastily pressed a two-franc piece above her
      eyebrows Safti addressed her animatedly in Arabic. I caught the word
      &ldquo;Smaïn.&rdquo; The lady smiled, and made a guttural reply; then, with a
      somnolent wink at me, she waddled onward, flapping the blood-red hands and
      stamping heavily upon the earthen floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smaïn loves that!&rdquo; I said to Safti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sidi. Oreïda is famous, and very rich. She has houses and many
      palm-trees, and she is much respected by the other dancers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week later Safti and I were again at Sidi-Matou, on our way homeward
      through the desert. The moon was at the full now, and when we rode up to
      the Bordj the open space in front of it, between us and the village, was
      flooded with delicate light. Against it one tree, which looked like
      Paderewski grown very old, stood up with tousled branches. In the village
      bonfires flared, and the dark figures of skipping children passed and
      re-passed before them. We heard youthful cries echoing across the sands.
      Soon they faded. The lights went out, and the wonderful silence of night
      in the desert came in to its heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat on the edge of an old stone well before the Bordj, while Safti
      smoked his keef. Near midnight, quivering across the sands, came the faint
      sound of a flute moving from the village towards the deep obscurity of the
      palm gardens. I knew that air, those trills, those little runs, those
      grace notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Smaïn,&rdquo; I said to Safti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sidi. He will play all night alone among the palms. He is in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But with Oreïda! Is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he not say that she was like the first day after the fast of Ramadan?
      When an African says that his heart is big with love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flute went on and on, and I said to myself and to the moon, as I had
      often said before:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He that is born in the Sahara is an impenetrable mystery.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      SAFTI&rsquo;S SUMMER DAY.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Robert Hichens
    </h3>
    <p>
      Safti is a respectable, one-eyed married man who lives in a brown earth
      house in the Sahara Desert. He has a wife and five children, and in winter
      he works for his living and theirs. When the morning dawns, and the great
      red sun rises above the rim of the wide and wonderful land which is the
      only land that Safti knows, he wraps his white burnous around him, pulls
      his hood up over his closely-shaven head, rolls and lights his cigarette,
      and sets forth to his equivalent of an office. This is the white arcade of
      a hotel where unbelieving dogs of travellers come in winter. I am an
      unbelieving dog of a traveller, and I come there in winter, and Safti
      comes there for me. I, in fact, am Safti&rsquo;s profession. Byrne, and others
      like me, he lives. For a consideration he shows me round the market, which
      I knew by heart six years ago, and takes me up the mosque tower, from
      which I gazed over the flying pigeons and the swaying palms when Safti was
      comparatively young and frisky. Together we visit the gazelles in their
      pretty garden, and the Caïd&rsquo;s Mill, from which one sees the pink and
      purple mountains of the Aures. We ride to the Sulphur Baths, we drive to
      Sidi-Okba. We take our <i>déjeuner</i> out to the yellow sand dunes, and
      we sip our coffee among the keef smokers in Hadj&rsquo;s painted café. We listen
      to the songs of the negro troubadour, and we smile at Algia&rsquo;s dancing when
      the silver moon comes up and the Kabyle dogs round the nomads&rsquo; tents begin
      their serenades. And then I give Safti five francs and my blessing, and he
      bids me &ldquo;<i>Bonne nuit!</i>&rdquo; and his ghostly figure is lost in the black
      shadows of the palm-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Safti works hard, very hard in winter. The other day I asked him:
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get exhausted, Safti, with all this exertion to keep the Sahara
      home together? You are getting on in years now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes, Sidi; I am already thirty-two, alas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was thirty-five when I first met him; but he is as clever at
      subtraction as a London beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! So much! But, then, how can you keep up the wear and tear
      of this tumultuous life? You must have an iron strength. Such work as you
      do would break down an American millionaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Safti raised his one dark eye piously towards Allah&rsquo;s dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidi, I must labour for my children. But in the summer, when you and all
      the travellers are gone from the Sahara to your fogs and the darkness of
      your days, I take my little holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your holiday! But is it long enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It lasts for only five months, Sidi; but it is enough for me. I am strong
      as the lion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gazed at him with an admiration I could not repress. There was, indeed,
      something of the hero about this simple-minded Saharaman. We were at the
      edge of the oasis, in a remote place looking towards the quivering mirage
      which guards dead Okba&rsquo;s tomb. A tiny earthen house, with a flat terrace
      ending in the jagged bank of the Oued Biskra, was crouched here in the
      shade. From it emerged a pleasant scent of coffee. Suddenly Safti&rsquo;s bare
      legs began to &ldquo;give.&rdquo; I felt it would be cruel to push on farther. We
      entered the house, seated ourselves luxuriously upon a baked divan of mud,
      set our slippers on a reed mat, rolled our cigarettes, and commanded our
      coffee. When a Kabyle boy with a rosebud stuck under his turban had
      brought it languidly, I said to Safti:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Safti, tell me how you pass your little holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Safti smiled gently in his beard. He was glad to have this moment of
      repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Each day is like its brother, Sidi,&rdquo; he responded, gazing out through the
      low doorway to the shimmering Sahara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me how you pass a summer day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coffee nerved him to this stubborn exertion, and he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sahah</i> Sidi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Merci</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A day in summer, Sidi, when the great heats begin in June? Well, at five
      in the morning I get up&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And light the fire,&rdquo; I murmured mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one eye stared in blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed, Safti. You get up at five. That is very early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun rises at a quarter to five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To call you. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I eat three fresh figs, and sometimes four. I then mount upon my mule,
      and I ride very quietly into Biskra to take coffee with my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is half-an-hour&rsquo;s exercise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About half-an-hour. After taking coffee with my friends we play at
      dominoes. It is forbidden for the Arabs to play at cards in Biskra. I
      remain in the café at the corner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;by the Garden of the Gazelles!&rdquo; &ldquo;&mdash;till eleven o&rsquo;clock,
      at which time I again mount upon my mule, and return quietly to my home.
      When I reach there I eat with my wife and children sour milk, bread, and
      dates from my palm-trees which I have kept from the autumn. At twelve we
      all go to bed together in a black room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A black room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We fear the flies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till four in the afternoon I, my wife, and my children sleep in the black
      room. At that hour I rise once more, and go quietly to the Café Maure in
      old Biskra, near my house. I play cards there for five coffees till seven
      o&rsquo;clock. At seven the mosquitoes arrive, and prevent us from playing any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How intrusive! Always at seven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always at seven. I then walk very quietly with my friends to the end of
      the oasis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Tombuctou road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sidi; to get the air. We come back by the same road quietly, and I
      go to my house, and eat a cold kous-kous with my wife and children. After
      this I return to the café and play ronda till one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One o&rsquo;clock at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. At one o&rsquo;clock I go with my friends very quietly to bathe in the
      stream beneath the wall near the mosque. We stay in the water for,
      perhaps, an hour, and when we come out we drink lagmi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s lagmi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Palm wine. Then at three o&rsquo;clock I go to my home, mount upon the roof
      quietly with my wife and children, and sleep till dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you do this for five months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For five months, Sidi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and your wife, Safti?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt that I was very indiscreet; but Safti is good-natured, and has
      bought quite a number of palm-trees out of his savings when with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife, Sidi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she do all the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She remains quietly in my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never goes out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, except upon the roof to take a little air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she get rather bor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The one eye began to look remarkably vague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you find five months of this life a sufficient rest in the course of
      the year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Safti smiled at me with resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot take more, Sidi; I am not a rich Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Safti, you must make the best of your fate. It is the will of Allah
      that you should toil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Shal-làh!</i> I will take another coffee, Sidi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Larbi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I called the Kabyle boy.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
